# MNIST-pytorch
 
This is a machine learning project that is able to predict a handwritten numeral using a neural network. The code, written in PyTorch, covers preprocessing, model creation, training loop setup, optimizer selection, and learning rate scheduling.

While the code itself is finished, my next step will be to convert this to a Jupyter Notebook so that the results are accessible.
